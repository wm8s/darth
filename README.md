// This program simulates an elevator from the HiRise dorm at the
// West Virginia Institute of Technology in Montgomery, WV.
//
// The Ground floor held the laundry, the "kitchen" (an old beat-up
// electric stove that we used to reheat Kroger pizzas), the ice machine,
// and a secret magical places where I spent a lot of time with a
// butt set, a punchdown tool, and a spool of made-to-look-old 
// cross-connect wire.
//
// The 1st floor held the cafeteria, open for three squares a day,
// plus very, very late at night and on the weekends if you knew the KGM.
//
// The 2nd floor held the arcade, mailboxes, office, and RD's apartment.
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// Possible future enhancements:
//
// Occasionally, the lamp on a floor would burn out; it would often be
// a long time before it was fixed.
//
// Occasionally, an elevator would stop working; it might also be a long time
// before it would be repaired.
//
// Occasionally, the elevator car would stop and get stuck between floors.
//
// Occasionally (although mercifully not often), the elevator would just
// decide that your underwear were too clean, so it would let go of the car
// and let you fall a couple of floors under gravity. This was not too bad 
// if you started on the 3rd floor, but if you started on the 9th or 
// 10th floor, it could get pretty exciting.
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// This is the world's most useless machine because this elevator (technically,
// a bank of two elevators) is gone.
//
// This elevator is gone because HiRise is gone.
//
// HiRise is gone because Tech is gone.
